<h1>The Best TV Shows According to TJ</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Shows of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Friends</h3>
<p>The show is very relatable, quotable, and funny!
<br />
I would also consider it my "comfort show".
</p>
<h3>2. The Sons of Anarchy</h3>
<p>This show has an INCREDIBLE story. It is quite brutal and wouldn't be suitable for all people, though
</p>
<h3>3. The Good Place</h3>
<p>This show is very fun and has a gripping story that will make you laugh & cry.
<br />
Despite it's subject, though, it is not a "Christian" show nor does it have theology that aligns with the Christian faith. Keep this in mind when watching or referring the show to a friend.
